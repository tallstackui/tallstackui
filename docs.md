# TallStackUI 4.x

Running record of everything that changed on the `4.x` branch relative to `3.x`.

Entries are grouped by component, most recently touched first. Within a component,
changes are split into **Added**, **Changed** and **Fixed**. Anything that requires
action from an upgrading application carries a **Migration** note.

Soft customization keys are part of the public API: renaming, nesting or removing a
block breaks applications that target it through `TallStackUi::customize()`. Every
such change is listed under **Migration**.

## Form / Select / Styled

### Fixed — grouped children were unreachable under a custom `value` key

The grouped template read children from a hardcoded `option.value` while the rest
of the component resolved them through the configured mapping. With
`select="label:name|value:id"` the dropdown rendered the group headers and nothing
else — the select opened but nothing could be picked.

The template now reads `option[selectable.value]`, matching what `_flatItems()` and
the `available` getter already did.

Note the shape this implies: the mapped `value` key carries the child list on a
group **and** the scalar value on a child, so both levels use the same key.

```php
// select="label:name|value:id"
['name' => 'Brazil', 'id' => [
    ['name' => 'São Paulo', 'id' => 4],
]]
```

### Fixed — a grouped child hid its image when it had no description

The `<img>` inside a grouped row bound its `src` to the image but gated its
visibility on the **description**. A child with an image and no description
rendered the image with `display: none`; a child with a description and no image
rendered an empty `<img>`. Visibility now follows the image, as it already did for
non-grouped rows.

The group header had the sibling problem: it read `option.image` and
`option.description` raw while the label next to it went through the mapping. Both
now respect `select`.

### Fixed — a list mixing groups and loose options dropped the grouped items

`grouped` was assigned inside the loop that normalizes options, so it kept only the
**last** option's answer. A list whose last entry was a plain option resolved to
"not grouped", the grouped branch never rendered, and every nested item vanished.
Worse, the group itself became a selectable row whose value was the whole child
array, so picking it pushed an array into a scalar `wire:model`.

The flag is now the union across all options, and it no longer overwrites an
explicit `grouped` attribute. On the JavaScript side `_flatItems()` and the
`available` getter probed only the first option for the same decision; both now
test every option.

Groups and loose options render side by side, the way `<optgroup>` and `<option>`
coexist in a native select:

```php
:options="[
    ['label' => 'Brazil', 'value' => [
        ['label' => 'São Paulo', 'value' => 4],
    ]],
    ['label' => 'Uncategorized', 'value' => 99],
]"
```

Loose rows render without the group indent and are selectable like any other item.

### Fixed — multiple grouped select closed the panel after the wrong number of picks

In multiple mode the dropdown is meant to stay open until every option has been
taken. The check compared the number of selections against `available.length`, but
for grouped options `available` holds the **groups**, not the selectable items.

With two groups of two cities each, the panel closed after the second pick and then
never closed at all:

| Pick          | selections | `available.length` | result       | expected     |
|---------------|------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------|
| São Paulo     | 1          | 2                  | stays open   | stays open   |
| Rio de Janeiro| 2          | 2                  | **closes**   | stays open   |
| New York      | 3          | 2                  | stays open   | stays open   |
| Los Angeles   | 4          | 2                  | **stays open** | closes     |

The count now comes from the flattened item list, which is what `_flatItems()`
already produces for hydration. Non-grouped selects are unaffected — `_flatItems()`
returns its input untouched when the list is not grouped.

### Changed — selected items from a grouped list are labelled `group > item`

Inside the open dropdown an item sits under its group header, so its own label is
enough to identify it. Once the dropdown closes that context disappears: a select
showing `São Paulo` no longer says which country it came from, and two groups
holding an item of the same name became indistinguishable.

Selected items are now qualified with their group:

```
single:   [ Brazil > São Paulo                          ✕ ⌵ ]

multiple: [ (Brazil > São Paulo ✕) (United States > New York ✕) ]
```

This covers the closed single-select label, the chips in multiple mode, and labels
restored on page load from `wire:model`.

Only the display changes. `wire:model` still receives the item's raw `value`, and
the rows inside the open dropdown keep showing their plain label under the group
header. Non-grouped selects are untouched.

Mechanically, `preNormalize()` now stamps each child with its group label while it
already walks the group tree, and a `display()` helper builds the qualified string
at the three points that render a selection. Because the stamp rides on the option
objects themselves, it survives `_flatItems()` and works the same for local
`:options` and remote `:request` sources.

**Migration.** The separator is fixed as ` > ` and there is no attribute to opt out.
Applications that render grouped selects in narrow containers may need to widen
them, and any test asserting the exact text of a selected grouped item has to
expect the qualified form.

## Form / Autocomplete

### Added — `metadata` passthrough on items

Items now accept a `metadata` key carrying arbitrary consumer data. The component
never reads, filters or renders it — it only keeps it reachable from the Alpine
`selected` state and from the `select` event payload, so the application can react
to which item was picked.

```php
[
    'value' => 'Alice',
    'description' => 'admin',
    'metadata' => ['id' => 42, 'role' => 'admin', 'team_id' => 7],
]
```

```json
[
  { "value": "Alice", "description": "admin", "metadata": { "id": 42, "role": "admin" } }
]
```

```blade
<x-autocomplete wire:model="user"
                :request="route('api.users')"
                x-on:select="$wire.userPicked($event.detail.item.metadata)" />
```

Works identically for local items (`:items`) and remote results (`:request`), since
both go through the same normalization step.

`metadata` is deliberately a namespaced bucket rather than a flat passthrough of
unknown keys. Flattening would mean that any internal key the component adds in a
future version silently overwrites consumer data.

What `metadata` does **not** do:

- it is not matched by the search filter (only `value` and `description` are);
- it is not rendered in the dropdown row;
- it is not sent to `wire:model` — the model still receives `value`.

### Fixed — documented item passthrough that never worked

The 3.x documentation described `$event.detail.item` as
`{ value, description?, image?, disabled?, ...whatever you put there }` and showed
`$event.detail.item.id` in an example. That was never true: normalization rebuilt
each item from the four known keys and dropped everything else, so any extra field
arrived as `undefined`. The docs now describe the real shape, and `metadata` is the
supported way to attach custom data.

## List

### Fixed — phantom divider above the first visible row after a search

Filtering a searchable list down to a row that was not the first row in the DOM
painted a spurious top border against the search row's bottom border, reading as a
single thick divider.

The dividers were keyed on an adjacent-sibling selector over `data-list-row`. Rows
are hidden with `x-show`, which sets `display: none`, and hidden elements still
participate in CSS sibling matching — so a visible row preceded only by *hidden*
rows still matched `[data-list-row] + [data-list-row]` and got a `border-t`.

Every row now also carries `data-list-on`, which Alpine drops while the row is
filtered out, and the divider is keyed on the general-sibling combinator:

```
[&>[data-list-on]~[data-list-on]]:border-t
```

`A ~ B` matches a visible row that has at least one *visible* row before it, which
is exactly "every visible row except the first visible one". No DOM-position
selector (`+`, `:not(:first-child)`, `divide-y`) can express this while hidden
siblings are still in the tree.

**Migration.** Applications overriding the `items.wrapper` block of `<x-list>` must
key their dividers on `data-list-on` rather than `data-list-row`, or the artifact
comes back.

### Added — raw content in the caption and a new `action` slot

`<x-list.items>` accepts consumer markup in two positions.

`caption` keeps working as a plain string attribute (HTML-escaped) and additionally
accepts a slot for arbitrary markup:

```blade
<x-list.items name="production">
    <x-slot:caption>
        <x-badge text="12 servers" color="red" sm />
    </x-slot:caption>
</x-list.items>
```

The new `action` slot renders controls on the right of the row without the ellipsis
dropdown chrome, and coexists with `<x-slot:menu>`:

```blade
<x-list.items name="general" caption="1 server">
    <x-slot:action>
        <x-button sm wire:click="deploy('general')">Deploy</x-button>
    </x-slot:action>
    <x-slot:menu>
        <x-dropdown.items text="Edit" wire:click="edit('general')" />
    </x-slot:menu>
</x-list.items>
```

Both are mirrored in data-driven mode through `@interact('item_caption', $item)` and
`@interact('item_action', $item)`, alongside the existing `@interact('item_menu')`.

Search still works when the caption is markup: the component registers a plain-text
projection of the slot (tags stripped, whitespace collapsed), so a caption rendered
as a badge continues to match its visible text.

**Migration.** When `action` and/or `menu` are present, both are grouped inside a new
`content.aside` wrapper (`flex shrink-0 items-center gap-x-2`). Rows that previously
rendered only a menu now carry one extra `<div>`. Applications selecting the menu
wrapper by DOM position rather than by class may need adjusting.

### Changed — `caption` excluded from the debug overlay

`caption` gained `#[SkipDebug]`, matching `menu` and `empty`, because a
`ComponentSlot` value would otherwise dump raw HTML into the debug panel. The
caption no longer appears in the overlay when `TALLSTACKUI_DEBUG_MODE` is on.

## Stats

### Added — `duration` prop

Controls the count-up animation length. Defaults to `1` and is clamped to a
non-negative integer.

### Changed — number styling driven by the `number` prop and the `color` prop

Number styles are applied only through the `number` prop, leaving the default slot
free for raw markup. The `number` customization block no longer hardcodes
`text-primary-500` — the text color now follows the component's `color` prop. The
count-up animation is gated to numeric values.

Non-`href` clickable roots render as a `div` with a pointer cursor instead of an
anchor.

**Migration.** Soft customization keys changed shape:

| 3.x                            | 4.x                       |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `wrapper.second-no-slot`       | removed, folded into `wrapper.second` |
| `header` / `header-string-wrapper` | `header.text` / `header.wrapper` |
| `footer` / `footer-string-wrapper` | `footer.text` / `footer.wrapper` |

### Added — validation for conflicting direction flags

`increase` and `decrease` can no longer be used together; doing so throws
`InvalidArgumentException` (surfaced by Blade as `ViewException`).
